Launch file for manual waypointing. Assumed that the f1tenth_ws is loaded, or atleast some of the vesc topics are loaded.

Built using nav2 keepout_params, and a pre-mapped `minicity.yaml`. 
The map was created by driving the robot around manually with our intel realsense to create a 2d costmap. It was then manually annotated what were the white lines it could be kept in.
